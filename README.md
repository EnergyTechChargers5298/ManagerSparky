# ManagerSparky
Team 5298's Discord bot! Sparky's here to help seamlessly, well, manage your FIRST Robotics team and your members. Functions like sending out reminders and the schedule during competitions to ensure that your team is (hopefully) ready for competition day. It offers a lot of tools for mentors and coaches to delegate and manage members depending on what they should do.
